# About

I am Danyl Fernandes a 20 y/o developer and I author the blogs on this website.
I was inspired to create this website after hearing [Kaushik Gopal](https://jkl.gg) in [this](https://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/188/) podcast episode.

This blog runs on Jekyll. Jekyll is awesome and I love it.

This is an original theme that was designed by myself.

I'm 20, a devout follower of Jesus Christ and I love exploring The Holy Bible to find and share the wonderful secrets hidden in it

I'm also an Android Developer and I love developing apps that help others and simplify unnecessarily difficult tasks. (I also love javascript :hugs:)

I love trying out different stacks (Recently, I was tinkering with JAMstack)

I love hearing podcasts and [The Fragment Podcast](https://fragmentedpodcast.com/) is 
my favorite
