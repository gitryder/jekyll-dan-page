* The Robbed Car
    * Metadata
        * **Taken:**  3/6/2020
        * **Shared with:** Ellona
    * **Description:**
        * I was inside the mall and I saw myself exiting the mall. When I arrived outside, I saw my car (a sedan) parked on the other side of the road.
        * I go to my car and behind me I see R entering a restaurant with her Mother, Father, and a sister (Interestingly, she doesn't have a sister but two brothers. However, they were not present)
        * I enter the restaurant and pass by her and she looks at me with hope and recognises me but doesn't say anything. 
        * I normally pass by and see a chair empty on a table where two were already seated.
        * I ask them if I could sit with them and they agree. Then, I order my food (which was tea and some other snacks that I don't remember)
        * Sometime later, I finish and begin to leave. I go to the billing counter to pay for my food.
        * The cashier tells me that my bill amount is a ₹1000 and I'm dumbfounded by that
        * I ask him why the tea and snacks were so expensive and he replies with, "The snacks you ate were very expensive sir"
        * When I agree to pay, he tells me that the bill amount is some hundreds over ₹3000
        * I'm totally shocked at this point and I tell him that it will not be possible for me to pay that amount and then he has pity on me and says, "Ok. Pay ₹250 and go"
        * I pay him that amount and leave.
        * When I come out to my car. I see that the car's lights were blinking because someone tried to open the car.
        * Immediately, I realise that the car is not mine but Jay's. 
        * Then I see that there's someone inside the car on the driver's seat. Someone I don't know (could be a thief) 
        * He tells me to wait for a minute and that he would leave the car now.
        * He opens the door of the car and I hold on to the car, but to my surprise, he suddenly begins to drive
        * I don't know how I hold on to the moving car but I saw that we're suddenly in a basement where there are a lot of vending machines. 
        * He leaves the car and gets out of the car and tells me that you had left the car door open and that's why I took the car
        * Then I take back the car and he has left by this point
