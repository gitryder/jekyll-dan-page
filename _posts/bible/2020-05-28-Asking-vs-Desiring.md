# Asking vs. Desiring

Have you ever thought about the difference between Asking and Desiring?
Maybe you've always thought that they're the same. Should you ask God for spiritual gifts?

This post should answer those questions. Punch the enemy for no reason at all:boxing_glove:and Let's begin...

## There is a difference

First let me establish the difference...

> Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you - *Matthew 7:7 KJV*

The Bible says "ask" and it shall be given to you. Notice it says, "ask"


**Now let's look at desiring**

> Follow after charity, and **desire spiritual gifts**, but rather that ye may prophesy - *1 Corinthians 14:1*

Here the Bible does not say *ask* spiritual gifts, it says *desire* spiritual gifts :astonished:

Let's see another verse..

> Delight thyself also in the Lord: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. - *Psalm 37:4*

Again, the Bible says that God will give us what? what we ask for? NO! **"the desires of your heart"**

Now, you might think this is just English, nothing to worry, but no, the Greek words used have a massive difference. 

The word used for *ask* is ['aiteó'](https://biblehub.com/greek/154.htm) which means *to ask, request or beg* **but** the word used for *desire* is ['zéloó'](https://biblehub.com/greek/2206.htm) which literally means *to be jealous and eager to possess*. 

Please read those meanings well, at least twice.

## Spiritual Gifts

> The TL;DR is you should *desire* Spiritual gifts and not *ask* God for them

Have you ever had people tell you that you should pray and ask God for a certain Spiritual gift? Let's, for instance, take the Gift of Tongues, I have always had people tell me to pray for that Gift. 

Although I have the gift now, but I want to let you know that I *never* prayed for it. I always only desired it. At intercessions, I would envy people that spoke in tongues. Whenever I was in [Church](https://karunasadan.com/en), I would admire Pastor Michael Fernandes, I would envy him when he spoke in tongues :blush:

So, the [TL;DR](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=tldr+meaning) is you should *desire* Spiritual gifts and not *ask* God for them. There are things  (according to the Bible) that you must ask but Spiritual gifts aren't part of those things. 

## Understanding the difference

> ...you cannot desire what you have not seen or heard about but you can ask what you have not even seen

Understand this first, you cannot desire what you have not seen or heard about but you can ask what you have not even seen. What?! How?! :confused:

Have you ever desired a BMW Vision 10? I'm sure you have not. Why? Simply because you don't know what it is and neither have you ever seen it. (I just made up that car name nothing like that exists :rofl:)

But see you can ask for anything, you can ask for things that you haven't even seen. This is why we can ask God to show himself to us, even though we have never seen him before yet *asking* works here. You asked for milk as an infant when you didn't even know what it actually was.

## Why desire?

> ...what you desired with all your life, you will value more when you receive it

But why does God want you to desire? Because when you receive what what you desired only then it can become a testimony in your life. How, Danyl?

Imagine if you're desiring an iPhone - an Apple device but instead of an iPhone you are gifted the best of class phone but its an Android phone. There's no way you'll be happy because no matter how expensive the Android phone is, *you desired for something* else :stuck_out_tongue:

When God gives you what you desire (Psalm 37:4) it becomes a sure shot testimony in your life because you know much you've desired and how patiently you have waited for it

## Final Words

Here are some things from my own experience, that might help

* First of all, find someone (a Pastor, Prophet, Apostle etc), in-person, on YouTube or otherwise who has the gift that you want too
* Desiring means *being jealous of* in Greek. So get jealous (in a good way) of the gifts that the person that you're looking up to has.
* Desires must get stronger by the day, not weaker.
* **One quality of desires is that if you have a desire for something people will easily notice it (no Word of Knowledge required for this).** 
  * Eg. Anyone can look at me in real life and tell how much I desire to be successful.  
  * Even non-spiritual desires alike -- You can look at me and tell how much I love technology
  * Desires are very public (if they are real)

#### Now finally but most importantly, Delight yourself in the Lord. You can desire as much as you want but God alone can fulfil desires. God bless you! Shalom.
