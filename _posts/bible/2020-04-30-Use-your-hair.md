# Use your hair 

> And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; - *Mark 16:17 KJV*

Before you speak in tongues, cast out demons.

I have never had any spiritual person tell me that I should "bind" or "cast" demons out. Never. I have instead heard some speak that you need to have a very old relation with God to do all this. 

So (according to them) one can cast out demons etc. after they've been in ministry for 8-10+ years...:man_facepalming:

**Now,** Let me explain what you need in order to break strongholds, using the story of the Strongest man of the Bible -- Samson

## Hair Explained

Look we have all read about Samson, right? But I always wondered what his hair actually meant? Until I asked the Lord. *He answered*

> "...If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me" - *Judges 16:17 NLT*

Samson's hair was a container. Understand this: **Samson's hair was not his strength; his hair contained his strength**.

Please take a moment to read that again. That is deep.

Samson's hair was not his strength; his hair contained his strength. It was not the power, but  it contained the power.

Imagine, I want to give you 1 million rupees, shouldn't you first have a bank account to contain it? In the very same way, Samson's hair worked as a container where God sent him strength

**But Danyl, why only hair?** Because God called Samson to be a Nazirite from birth and Nazirites are not allowed to cut their hair. So when Samson's hair was cut, he wasn't a Nazirite anymore which broke the covenant

## Where's your hair?

> ..longer the hair, greater the power

Samson's hair is symbolic of a relationship with God. When Samson's hair was gone, his power was sapped away. When you lose your relation with God to sin; you lose strength. You become sad in the spirit, this is why the bible says, "A broken spirit saps a person's strength" (Proverbs 17:22) 

Samson never cut his hair since birth which means he must have had really long hair before it was cut by the Philistines.

The longer the hair, the greater it can contain. Hence, the longer the hair (relation with God), the greater the power you will walk in.

## Hair will grow

> But before long, his hair began to grow back. - *Judges 16:22 NLT*	

See you cannot make your hair grow. You just cannot. May be you always think that my relation with the Lord isn't growing. STOP! Stop thinking about growing relationship because you cannot make it grow.

Hair grows automatically with time. Its the same with a relationship with the Lord. **You keep doing the stuff you know you have to do -- giving, praying, fasting (Matt 6).** Your relation with the Lord will grow automatically everyday little-by-little if you are consistent.

## Little is a lot

> ...So he killed more people when he died than he had during his entire lifetime. - *Judges 16:28 NLT*

Samson's eyes were taken out. His hair was too short now (Judges 16:22). But could that stop Samson. Not one bit. 

Look at the sequence carefully...

* Samson makes a plan -- he tells the young servant to place his hands against the pillars that hold the temple. **Notice Samson planned big. Even when on the verge of losing his life, He Planned big.**
* Remember that his hair was still small at this point. Yet he runs to God and cries out to God saying, "God, one last time. Please". **Notice Samson planned before he could ask God for power not after**
* Finally, verse 28: Samson kills more people than he had killed in his entire lifetime :astonished:

**God sent power even when Samson had little hair.** I want to encourage you my brother/sister you can do great things even with little hair. Hair will keep growing, don't wait for it to grow, ```Use the little```

## Final Checklist

I want to leave you with a some steps to incorporate in your life

* Be faithful to God in all things. Keep sin at bay
* Bother about obeying God; Relationship will grow on its own -- just like hair
* Don't ask God for power without having a plan. *You need a plan to defeat the enemy*
* God doesn't give you plans. You make plans; He blesses plans (Proverbs 16:3)
* Don't listen to every other Pastor. 
* Pastors, Teachers are good but **learn the Bible for yourself**

#### Use your little hair. Ask God for power and destroy the works of the enemy in your life and in the lives of others. God bless you! Shalom.
