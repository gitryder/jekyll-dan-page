# Labor Pains & the Bible

Have you ever wondered why women are still under the curse of childbirth pain - why do they still experience labor pains if Jesus took all curses? Is it even a curse? Is it for all women?

**So many questions! :anguished:**

Worry not! I bring some answers to you through the explaining of secrets hidden in the Bible.

Before I begin, I want to remind you of the goodness of Our Heavenly Father. He is too good to look at you crumbling in pain. Albeit, I love answering questions using the Bible and this is a good question. So let's begin...

## Disclaimer

All the views expressed here are my own. I do not intend to copy another's work for self-glorification. 

## Adding to the question

**Now,** If God allows us to stay single (1 Cor 7:7), then all the women that are single are saved from the curse of labor pain. Which means there is a loophole in God's system? Which makes God unjust?!

Which would mean that the curse of pain is only for some women? WHAT?!

Let's dive deep...:ocean: 

## The happenings in the Garden

> And it was not Adam who was deceived by Satan. The woman was deceived, and sin was the result - 1 Tim 2:14 NLT

Man, Woman and the Serpent were equally cursed in one way or another in the book of Genesis. God cursed **the serpent first**, **the woman next** and **the man finally** -- in this exact order (Gen 3:14-17)

You see, Adam did not sin first; Eve did. But Adam supported her sin by eating the fruit later, which made Adam equally guilty. Yet, God in all is perfection and goodness, had to curse Adam and Eve (possibly with a heavy heart, because he loves us so much) **because God is a just judge**

## The two curses

According to Genesis 3:16, there were two curses put on Eve: 

* That she would bring forth children in sorrow
* That she would want to rule control her husband, but he would rule over her

Let's go deeper into the meanings of these...

#### Defining Sorrow

> For all have sinned, and **come** short of the glory of God - Romans 3:23 KJV

We have **come** short of the glory of God - we are born with the original sin of Adam and Eve, and when we bring children into the world, we bring sin into the world

The word "sorrow" in Gen 3:16 is the Hebrew word "itstsabon" - which means toil. It **does not mean *physical pain***, It **means *mental pain***

The mental pain of *bringing sin into the world* 

#### Defining rule

> For there is no respect of persons with God. - Romans 2:11 KJV

God **does not** favor any single gender. This curse spoke of the division that sin brought between God and man.

**Now, the revelation that the Lord has allowed me to have, proceed with caution**

Women were called by God to be a partner with man, she was created as a companion to man she was created to be equal to man, but sin caused her to be put under her husbands rule (Gen 3:16, 1 Tim 2:12)

> **Revelation:**
> God made our spirits in His own image (Gen 1:26) and He called His bride (we -- the church of God) to be at His level. But as sin brought Eve under her husband, sin brought us under Jesus making us unworthy to have Him as our husband. Hence, Jesus had to come down for us to make us worthy of Himself

## The Mathematics of the Curse

Let's now dive deep into the mathematics of the first curse that was put upon Eve...

> To **the woman** He said, â€œI will greatly **multiply** ***Your*** pain in childbirth;
> In pain **you** will give birth to children; - Genesis 3:16 AMP

There are two keys that I want you to notice here:

* "the woman", your, you
* multiply

Let's go step-by-step...

### One Woman

Notice, the bible says (in all translations), God said to **"the woman" - which was Eve**, "I will multiply **your** pain"

God did not say that he would multiply the pain of all women on Earth, rather the Bible says, YOUR pains - Eve's pain alone

### Multiplication, not Addition

> ...childbirth pain wasn't **added** by God it was only **multiplied** by God.

God said, "I will **MULTIPLY** your pain"

* Simple logic, can you multiply 0? If you can, I lose, we stop right here.

* You cannot multiply 0. **You cannot multiply what does not exist**

* Which means, childbirth pain wasn't **added** by God it was only **multiplied** by God.
* Which means, even if Eve hadn't sinned, she would experience pain during childbirth

Now why did he do that? Is He cruel? No! That I will explain in a future article.

Danyl, I'm getting you now, but wait I have always been told that pain came into the world because of sin and you are saying pain existed already and God only multiplied it? WHAT?!!

**Read ahead**...

## Sin and Pain - The Connection

> And it **repented** the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it **grieved** him at his heart. - Genesis 6:6 KJV

The Hebrew word used for "grieved" there is the word "atsab", which means to pain

God is perfect and He cannot sin, He is joy and He gives joy, yet, in the verse above we see that God's heart was grieved - his heart was caused pain :astonished:

### The "will to cause pain"

> ...sin did not bring pain, sin brought the "will to cause pain"

Please read that statement at least 3 times and only then proceed. **This following section is very important, please read very carefully.**

Sin brought death into the world (Romans 5:12). 

* Sin brought death into the world, not pain. 
* Pain existed already. 
* God did not make us emotionless, feeling-less, painless

But, In a sinless world, you would never experience pain **because no one would have the desire to cause you pain**. In Simple words, sin did not bring pain, sin brought the "will to cause pain".

Cain killed Abel. Abel must have felt the pain, right? 

**But, Abel's pain was not caused because of sin, Abel's pain was caused because of Cain's "will to cause pain".**

**And this "will to cause pain" is called sin (1 John 5:17)**

## Final Words

Jesus defeated death on the cross, not pain. To defeat death, he went through pain. Because pain is itself is not harmful, but the thing it brings -- death -- is what we fear.

Everything must undergo pain. This is why Jesus said, "a seed must fall to the ground and **die**"

* This ground has been cursed and hence pain will continue to exist but undeserved pain shall never touch us as believers in Christ (Proverbs 26:2)
* A caterpillar must bear pain and break through the cocoon to turn into a butterfly.
* I will never experience labor pain for sure, but men aren't exempted from pain either :slightly_smiling_face:
* Men too have their shares of mental pain not because of God, but because of the enemy. God is no respecter of persons. He can never see you in pain
* In Paradise alone shall all pain be removed and there will be eternal joy
* The pain of childbirth will always exist because pain alone can show you the greatness of the joy that comes after
* You will only respect the morning if there is a night of darkness and uncertainty

#### The pain that you are feeling now cannot be compared the joy that's coming (Romans 8:18). God bless you! Shalom.
