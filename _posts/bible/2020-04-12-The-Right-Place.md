# The Right Place

Have you ever thought about **who** causes you to sin? Maybe you've blamed the devil for causing you to sin?
If you've thought so too, then this article is about to change that. I'm heavily armed with the Holy Scriptures of God so as to supply the truth to you. So, let's begin

## The will

So Danyl, if the devil doesn't cause me to sin, then who does? You see the devil cannot cause you to sin because the Almighty God - The Giver of all good things, has given you **choice**. 

YOU choose what to do - to sin or not to sin. 

* Jesus countered the enemy's *half-truths* with *the real truth*; even though He was tempted by the enemy, He did not ever give-in to those temptations. 
* Eve **did not** counter the enemy with the truth. Now, the devil **did not** pluck the fruit off the tree and hand it to Eve saying, "Here, take this fruit and eat it". He told her a half-truth that she would not die, hiding the other half that God meant spiritual death and hiding that eating it would be disobeying The Father's word.

Okay Danyl, I'm getting your point, but wait, if what you're saying is true then what is the devil's role in sin? Ah-ha! Read ahead to know...

## An ideal setup

The devil's role is to setup environments that are ideal and very suited to your style of sinning. In Other words, if you are trying to quit smoking, he doesn't necessarily hand you a cigarette, instead he gets you in the presence of chronic smokers. 

> Every setup is ideal and appropriate for that exact person to comfortably sin

Joseph was setup very well by the devil. Potiphar's wife was used by the devil to create an environment for Joseph to commit sin **but Joseph did not give-in to it.**

### Recognizing Environments

> Joseph did not pray there, he **ran**

The striking fact is that Joseph did not begin praying when faced with Potiphar's wife. Joseph did not pray there, he **ran**. 

Joseph ran because he understood that he's in the wrong place, that wasn't where he should've been so he **immediately corrected his mistake**. 

These are the important keys that you can implement into your life:

* Recognize your environment
* Take appropriate action (before its too late)

Take a two minute pause here and ponder upon this: When sin is knocking at your door, do you run? Or do you *wrongly put confidence in the flesh by thinking you can handle it alone? (Phil 3:17)*

### God's Perfect Environment.

> Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord *is*, there *is* liberty - *2 Cor 3:17 KJV* 

Where God's Spirit is, there is *liberty* and where the enemy is, there is *the opposite - captivity*

God planted the garden in **Eden**. *Eden* is a Hebrew word which means "place of pleasure, happiness, joy". This is how God's environments are - perfect!

> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty - *Psalms 91:1 KJV*

This is why the bible says, "...shall abide **under the shadow** of the Almighty". Now look, God doesn't have a shadow because He is Light (John 8:12), but this "under the shadow" speaks of an environment - God's environment. 

Know that you are forever safe in Godly environments.

## A few guidelines

> "Failing to prepare is **preparing to fail**"

* When you feel like sinning and giving in to temptation, chances are you are in the wrong environment because God's environment can never have an atmosphere of sin. God never tempts anyone, the enemy does (James 1:13)
* Make it a practice to constantly examine your environments - If you're idling around, wasting precious time doing nothing, you will most surely fall. Don't waste time (Eph 5:16), if you have nothing to do, pray or call me - we'll have a nice time studying the Word of God :stuck_out_tongue: 
* Ask the Holy Spirit to speak to you and guide you. He will only direct you in those areas that you submit to him (Proverbs 3:6)

## Final words

> Light must be taken to places, but darkness is default.

If you want Jesus to go with you wherever you go, you need to call him. Ask the Holy Spirit to lead you. Light must be taken with you, but darkness is default. Light does not come by itself, but darkness is default everywhere. Jesus is the light. Ask Jesus to come into your life - surrender to Him.

Ask the Holy Spirit to make Jesus real in your life and you will always have perfect direction. 

I thank you for reading this small article that I have written. Its small for the world but its God's gift to me. God bless you. Shalom.
