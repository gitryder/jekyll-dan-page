# Spirit, Soul and Body
Before we begin,

## Disclaimer
Some of the points in the beginning and towards the end **are an addition** to teachings from *Prophet Passion Java* and *Prophet Charles Ibrahim*. The rest is what the Lord has revealed to me. I do not, in any way, intend to blatantly copy what these men of God have preached in the past **but** to only use excerpts of their teachings as a base to build upon. Thank you!

## Let's Begin
* Your `Spirit` holds the future
* Your `Soul` holds the past
* Your `Body` is only a container

If your `Soul` leaves your body, you die. If its enters back, you live again.
But you don't die when your `Spirit` leaves the body, instead you can travel outside your body without dying using your `Spirit`

Therefore, you see people saying, "I'm seeing in the `Spirit`", because you cannot see in the `Soul`

# The Spirit holds your Purpose
* Before you came to earth, **you were** like *what you will be in heaven* after dying on earth.

* Your `Spirit` died in heaven, and you were born on earth. 
* That is why we call ourselves *Born Again* because you were born again on earth.

> Death in Heaven > Life on Earth
> Death on Earth > Life in Heaven (again)

This is exactly why Jesus said,
> "When the seed dies, it bringeth forth much fruit." - John 12:24 KJV

* Which means you died as a seed in heaven, but you came on earth as a fruit (bringing joy to your parents)
* And Jesus said, `"...much fruit"` which is true, because you come on earth (whether male or female) with the potential to bring forth fruit (children)

## How it happened in Heaven
* God Spoke your purpose, your calling to YOU and then He sent you on earth.
* Then you were born in the `Earth Realm`, but your memory of what God said had become faint.
* This is why you sometimes remember stuff and think you saw it in a dream, whereas what actually happened is that you were remembering the future again from your `Spirit`. (The people of the world call this phenomenon "Deja-Vu")
* This is why God said to Jeremiah, "I knew you before I formed you and I called you to be a Prophet to the nations"
* "I knew you". God knew him already because God ordained his purpose in Heaven

# Revelation of Rememberance
* Imagine you have not been talking to a close friend much. Years go by. 1 year. 2 years. 10 years. 16 years.
* Your memory of what you used to speak to the friend begins to grow faint. 
* You forget all the things they told you. 
* You begin to lose memory about them and dont even remember them anymore
* You become like a person who has lost their memory (like, Ghajini :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
* **Until,** someone reminds you of that person. You begin to remember the things about that person, You begin to remember the person and everything they told you comes to your mind little by little

## Understanding through my story
Using the analogy above, let me make my point (by referring to myself)
I'm 20 now. I came to Jesus in 2016, so my age was 16 then.

**Now this is the most important section, Please read carefully**
* I was already in Heaven and God knew me, but I came to Earth as a baby.
* When I entered the `Earth Realm` through my mother, I had forgotten everything.
* My memory of God and my purpose became more and more and more faint as years went by.
* 1 year. 4 years. 9 years. 16 years.
* When I was 16, my mother who had already come to know about Jesus, prayed for me earnestly and I began to remember God (at the time, I thought I knew God for the first time. But now you and I know the truth)
* I began to read The Holy Bible, and then started to connect the dots. 

## Understanding through Jesus' Story
> "And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was." - John 17:5 KJV

* Jesus was already in Heaven, already God, already glorified, hence He said, "..glorify me with the glory I had with thee, before the world ever was"
* But even though Jesus was not a baby in Heaven, yet He was born in the `Earth Realm` as a baby.
* He became a carpenter for 30 years
* **And then,** 30 years later, John, the Baptist, baptized him. Jesus was unlocked. Jesus was God too and He knew everything, yet He was reminded by God Himself when God said, "This is my Son, in whom I AM well pleased"
* Jesus was never the same after that, He did wonders no man had ever witnessed.
  
# Revelation in the Book of Joel
* Children can connect to God and remember everything God told them and everything in their `Spirit` better
* How? Because they are closer to heaven. A just born child has **just arrived** from heaven. This is the reason why some say that babies can see Angels and Spirits
* A 6 y/o can connect faster than a 16 y/o. A 16 y/o can connect faster than a 30 y/o. A 50 y/o can connect faster than a 80 y/o
* Why so? because for that many years they were not reminded that they knew someone called God.

## Let's Remind People
> "And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions" - Joel 2:28 KJV

**Read that verse very well. Only then you are allowed to continue to my final point** 

* Have you wondered how these new generation kids, so small, so young are able to prophesy and see visions and dreams? **Read Carefully now and you'll know**
* God said to Prophet Joel, "...YOUR sons and daughters...YOUR young men...YOUR old men"
* YOUR people. 
* Prophet Shepherd's children can prophesy BECAUSE HE REMINDED THEM OF THEIR PURPOSE BY TELLING THEM ABOUT GOD!
* YOUR people. YOUR young men. YOUR old men. YOUR sons and daughters.
* Your children will prophesy because you are already saved and you will be the one to tell them about God and they will remember Him and what He told them before He sent them on Earth.
* Your old men (parents) will dream dreams because you will remind them now of what the lord told them before your parents were even born.
* They will have their memory back from the `Spirit Realm` into the `Earth Realm` by tapping into it using the mechanism that God made us with - our `Spirit`

I thank you so much for reading through this. May the Lord bless you for reading what He has put on my heart. God bless you and may you be rebirthed in the Spirit!
