# Motivate Yourself

It is important to learn to motivate yourself, so let's see how :slightly_smiling_face:

Let's begin

### Situation

I've been at an all-time low at the time of this writing, probably for the longest time in my life. This is the most difficult time of my life right now because, you know, mental battles are remarkably more dangerous than physical battles

For over a month now I've been on a run - running from myself, running from the troubles of my mind.

I was crying out in my spirit longing for one person that could try to talk to me; get to understand what the problem and also explain my problem to me because sadly I don't exactly know my problem.

- I wanted just that one person that could motivate me again. I felt my strength would come back if someone gave me a tight hug and allowed me to cry endlessly upon their shoulders.
- I wanted someone to tell me that I'm going t

Crying helps a lot, man. A lot. But there's a point where you don't have the energy for that too. But, enough about me, let's talk about you...

### No blame-game, please!

> Alone you have come, alone you shall go

We humans inherently find someone to blame and that person is never ourselves. We _blame_ people because we _expect_ from those people.

- I blamed people too
- "Why couldn't God reveal my situation, my problem, my battle with somebody", I asked
- I blamed people for not hearing God

- I blamed some people for not motivating me. But, Little did this lad understand that people aren't obliged to motivate anyone, neither by love nor by responsibility.

So, please dear brother/sister don't blame anyone. Not even your closest ones. Alone you have come, alone you shall go. People have their own problems too, they're too busy.

Let me show you from the Bible who it should really be that must motivate you..

### Serve yourself

> And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: **but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.** _- 1 Samuel 30:6 KJV_

If you're going through the same thing right now, allow me to motivate you. Allow me to do to you what no one did for me and what no one will do for you

**Encourage yourself in the Lord**

David had no one to motivate him. None. Why? Because the people had their own problems -- their sons and daughters were gone.

See, I believe, David must have known that he needs to save them. He knew he could bring them back with the help of the Lord but HE NEEDED MOTIVATION. He did that himself.

Dear brother/sister, maybe you're going through a terribly rough patch in your life. I want to encourage you to **Motivate yourself**

I'm going to need some more time to pick myself up and put myself back together, maybe a really long time to digest the fact that I need to do it myself. But I know that the Lord is still alive.

**Jesus is still alive**

**He's still on his throne**

**Don't expect from people what you must expect from God**

...

### Some nice things to do

- Listen to Matthew West's songs (his songs really make you think and lead you to God)

Thanks for reading. This was a very short post because I don't have strength to type (even though I type very fast). God bless you! Shalom.
