# Thought Police

> Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life. - *Proverbs 4:23*

The Mind of a person is a place where the most amount of bloodshed has happened and still happens today. Dreams have been killed, Ideas have been killed, And worse still, People have been killed (by words & evil thoughts) 

Our Antagonist - the devil, has been defeating us on this ground since the world began. See, our countries have such civil forces as the Police & the Army, in place, for the maintenance of public order, but the place that lends itself to the service of colossal amounts of thought traffic - our minds, have nothing & no one to police it 

The Bible says in Proverbs 4:23, "**Guard** your mind for out of it flow the issues of life". That word "guard" is **the Hebrew word ['naw-tsar'](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5341.htm)** which means "to watch", as in, watching as a Watchman - watching to guard.

Now Imagine you have to guard your house, will you guard your house from the inside or from the outside? Will you setup guard at the gate or inside the gate? You will surely not setup guard *inside* the place you're guarding, but outside.

### Your Mind is that Gate

> "The Mind is the Gate to the Spirit"

The Bible tells us to guard the mind because The Mind is that Gate and *the Only Gate* to the Spirit.

Now you might have heard people tell you that the eye, the ears, the mouths are Gates, sure they are, **but they are not Gates to your Spirit, they are Gates to your Mind**

See the mind is the only Gate to your Spirit, all the other Gates lead **not to your Spirit, but to your Mind** (see the image below)

Take your house, for example, it has a single door at the entrance. When you enter through that door, do you suddenly reach your Bathroom? No, you reach the Living Room and then there is *another* door that leads to the Bathroom. 

In the very same way, what you see, what you hear & what you speak go to your Mind, and from the Mind into the Spirit. The destination of those things you see, hear, speak etc. is the Spirit, sure, but they cannot reach there without first passing through the Mind.

That is why the Bible says, "God is Spirit" (John 4:24) and Jesus is the head (Col 1:18). Haha, you didn't catch that! That's a deep revelation right there.

This is why we have to use the name of Jesus to ask God for anything (John 16:23) because you cannot communicate with the Spirit without first going through the Mind

Your Spirit holds the future - your desires, your calling, every day of your life that is pre-ordained by God. An attack to the mind is actually an attack with a purpose to enter the Spirit - the inner man

### Heart & Heart

The word 'heart' appears 800 times in the Bible but never does the Bible refer to the human heart - the organ that pumps blood. There are specifically two hearts from the Bible that I want to speak to you about:

The word : '◊ú÷µ◊ë'

- **Origin:** Hebrew
- **Transliteration:** leb
- **Pronunciation:** labe
- **Definition:** inner man, the mind
- **Reference:** Proverbs 4:23, "guard your **heart**"

**AND**

The word : 'Œ∫Œ±œÅŒ¥ŒØŒ±' 

- **Origin:** Greek
- **Transliteration:** kardia
- **Pronunciation:** kar-dee'-ah
- **Definition:** character
- **Reference:** Matthew 12:34, "out of the abundance of the **heart**"

Proverbs 4:23 and Matthew 12:34, juxtaposed, return astonishingly instructive results. Let me explain that simply:

* Guard your heart (leb) + Out of the abundance of the heart (kardia) the mouth speaks
* This means that the Bible is simply telling us to guard our 'leb' (inner man, mind) so that our kardia (character) remains pure

I don't know about you but that revelation just blew my mind ü§Ø

### Final Words:

* Your inner man - the heart is what you are supposed to guard, what is in your inner man will influence your kardia (character)
* Our characters as Believers is what separates us from the World. Jesus said, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, Love one another as I have loved you".
* Love doesn't just come overnight, Compassion doesn't just fall from heaven, Your character is what determines *how* you love others
* Setup guard. There is a dire need to police our thoughts. 
* God does not guard our minds, we ought to. You need to do it.
* Keep a close watch on what you watch, what you hear, what you see but more importantly guard your mind which means don't let anything wrong stay there and don't let anything wrong enter there. 
* Be a strong, dedicated watchman and ask the Lord to help you see what you need to guard your Mind from. It could be movies, It could be TV Shows, It could be the wrong songs, It could be the News, It could be the wrong friends, It could very well be your own mouth too
* Yes, It could be your mouth too, this is why God told Joshua and his people to shut their mouths for 7 days, so they wouldn't speak the wrong things

I'll leave you now, take sometime and think about what you need to do. May the Lord guide your steps (Prov 3:5-6). God bless you! Shalom!
